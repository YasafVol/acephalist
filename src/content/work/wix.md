• Unified Business Solutions integration by replacing a proprietary API with a developer-friendly TypeScript SDK, executing a zero-churn rollout, aligning with Wix's "Single API" vision.

• Driving a ground-up evolution of the Wix Code framework. Replacing the legacy build tool, enabling local-first builds, and introducing a dual syntax (manifest-based for power users, scaffolded for casual creators) to align with an open, AI-first "Single-API" vision.

• Led tech stack modernization for external developers, enabling AI-first development and moving to non-proprietary runtime and hosting solutions.

• Improved developer experience by introducing CI/CD pipeline and proto-Stage environment, coordinating six different teams to streamline build processes and provide code validations.
