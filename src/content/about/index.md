## Visual Representations

A visual journey through different representations of myself - from digital avatar to artistic interpretation.

## About Me

I am a **_software engineer_**, **_ui/ux designer_**, **_product planner_**, **_mentor_**, **_student_**, **_minimalist_**, **_eternal optimist_**, **_crypto enthusiast_** and **_sarcasm connoisseur_**.

I love to both build and break things. I am motivated by challenging projects with self-guided research and dynamic problem solving. My true passion is crafting creative front end designs with unique takes on color, typography and motion.

### During my career

I have built products ranging from marketing and ecommerce websites to complex enterprise apps with focus on delivering fast, elegant code along with delightful user interfaces.

### Now

I currently work as a software engineer at StreamlineFS, where I do product planning, design and development.
